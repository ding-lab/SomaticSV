# Somatic SV Workflow

Version 1.3
- Additional output written in bedpe format
  - conversion of VCF to bedpe performed with `svtools vcftobedpe`
  - svtools v0.5.1 https://github.com/hall-lab/svtools

Version 1.2
- Manta 1.6.0
  - note, all results associated with v1.2, which used image mwyczalkowski/somatic_sv:20200518, was in fact Manta 1.6.0 rather
    than 1.4.0 as was previously indicated
- Filters: Only select the variants from somaticSV.vcf.gz output which pass the following criteria:
    - Sample site depth is less than 3x the median chromosome depth near one or both variant breakends
    - Somatic score is greater than 30
    - For a small variant (<1000 bases) in the normal sample, the fraction of reads with MAPQ0 around either breakend doesn't exceed 0.4
- BAM files `evidence_0` and `evidence_1` generated with Manta argument `--generateEvidenceBam`

Version 1.1
- Manta 1.4.0 with tumor and normal sequence data
- Filtering as in v1.2, no BAM evidence files returned
