# Somatic SV Workflow

Version 1.1

- Manta 1.4.0
- Filters: Only select the variants which pass the following criteria:
    - Sample site depth is less than 3x the median chromosome depth near one or both variant breakends
    - Somatic score is greater than 30
    - For a small variant (<1000 bases) in the normal sample, the fraction of reads with MAPQ0 around either breakend doesn't exceed 0.4
- BAM files `evidence_0` and `evidence_1` generated with Manta argument `--generateEvidenceBam`
